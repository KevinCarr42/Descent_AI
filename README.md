# Descent Journeys in the Dark: AI Overlord

### Initial Attempt
- for v2, attempted simple AI with some easiness tweaks
- still too hard, not a great experience

### Future Ideas
- AI for specific monsters, like Gloomhaven or Sword & Sorcery
- autogenerated map
- need rules for spawning and overlord abilities (if any)

$$$ Map Ideas
- 3 sections, each with an approx number of tiles
- loop and randomly choose new tiles
- randomly attack to entire area, not the most recent tile
- add treasure and monsters
- repeat for each section
- shorter / less sections for shorter game
- consider blender or tabletop simulator for visual display
- ALT, just use instructions and build as required at table,
- players choice if conflicts
