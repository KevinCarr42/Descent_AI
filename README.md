# Descent Journeys in the Dark: AI Overlord

### Initial Attempt
- for Descent v2, attempted simple AI with some easiness tweaks
- still too hard, not a great experience

### Future Ideas
- for Descent v1
  - ideally usable in v2 with ease
- AI for specific monsters, like Gloomhaven and/or Sword & Sorcery
- autogenerated map
- need rules for spawning and overlord abilities (if any)
- autogen extra details
  - chests, doors/keys, obstacles

### Map Ideas
- 3 sections, each with an approx number of tiles
  - then boss battle
  - optional secret boss
  - shorter / less sections for shorter game
- loop and randomly choose new tiles
- randomly attach to entire area, not the most recent tile (will lead to less linear layout)
  - cap unused endpoints when new area unlocked
- autogen details
  - chests, potions, doors/keys, obstacles
- repeat for each section
- consider blender or tabletop simulator for visual display
  - or pygame/plt + flask for text/graphics
  - ALT, just use instructions and build as required at table
    - players choice if conflicts arise (error handling)
