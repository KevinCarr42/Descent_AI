# Rules
* Doors are locked until all monsters are defeated in the current area
* If obstacles block entire path, they can be destroyed with an attack action

### Notes
* Enemies in this AI version just use basic hero attacks and ignore overlord powers
* Enemies are able to battle, run, guard, etc., depending on their AI description / role

### Target / Default Target
* First check for ideal target within range = engaged
* If none, DEFAULT TARGET: Most damaged > lowest total HP > lowest defense > heros choice
* repeat with more distant ranges until a target is chosen

### Definitions
* Aim = reroll misses, surges = range
* Battle = make 2 attacks
* Berserk = if the monster has one or more wound tokens on it, it rolls all 5 power dice when attacking
* Dodge = reroll all non-misses on dice with miss icons
* Drain = each HP of drain is treated as a leech attack (-surges, heal monster)
* Fear = attacker must spend 1 surge for every Fear rank or the attack misses
* Flee = move max distance away from characters, maximize distance between monsters
* Form a line = 1st monster ends turn at range to target closest to obstruction/wall, subsequent enemies continue line to block maximum movement, starting at a wall when possible, prioritising the line over their preferred target when targets can be substituted
* Guard = makes an interrupt attack when a hero enters range
* Leech = for each wound lost due to a Leech attack, the target also loses 1 fatigue (or suffers 1 additional wound, ignoring armor, if out of fatigue) and the attacker is healed of 1 wound
* Range = the range at which enemies attacks are optimal (note: enemy orders include Â±1 range when checking if "at range")
* Run = move up to 2x speed
* Stealth = like an invisibility potion, roll stealth die to attack, every turn roll power die - surge means no more stealth
* Swarm = a figure with Swarm may roll 1 extra power die for every other friendly figure adjacent to its target. additional enemies attack the initial swarm target (and attacks gain the swarm effect)
* Undying n = Undying effect (roll power die, surge is ressurect) using n dice
